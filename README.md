# ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS-FOR-EQUIPMENT-FAILURES
🛠️ Root Cause Analysis for Equipment Failures

📌 Overview

This project provides a basic analytical framework to identify, visualize, and understand equipment failure patterns using Python. By leveraging root cause analysis techniques like the 5 Whys and Fishbone Diagram, the project demonstrates how to uncover underlying issues and prevent recurring equipment breakdowns.

🎯 Objectives

➤ Analyze historical equipment failure data

➤ Identify frequently failing equipment and common failure types

➤ Visualize failure trends and distributions

➤ Perform structured root cause analysis

📊 Data Source

The data used here is a sample equipment failure log created for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, this data would typically come from:

➤ Maintenance logs

➤ SCADA systems

➤ CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems)

Sample fields include:

➤ Date: When the failure occurred

➤ Equipment: The machine or unit that failed

➤ Failure Type: Nature of the failure (e.g., leak, overheating)

➤Root Cause: Identified reason for failure

🛠️ Technologies Used

1.Python: For scripting and analysis

2.Pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation

3.Matplotlib: Visualization of failure trends and distribution

📊 Visualizations

➤ Failures by Equipment – Bar chart showing frequency of failures per equipment

➤ Failure Type Distribution – Pie chart showing proportions of different failure types

➤ Failures Over Time – Line chart tracking failure events chronologically

🔍 Root Cause Analysis

➤ 5 Whys Analysis: A step-by-step reasoning chain for a sample failure (Pump A Seal Failure)

➤ Fishbone Diagram (Text Format): Cause categorization across six areas: Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, and Environment

▶️ How to Run

1.Clone the repository

2.Install the required packages

3.Run the script

4.Visuals and analysis will appear in the terminal and as plotted charts

✅ Future Enhancements

➤ Integration with real-world datasets from maintenance systems

➤ Interactive dashboards (e.g., using Plotly or Dash)

➤ Predictive failure modeling using machine learning
